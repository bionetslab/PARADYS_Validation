# PARADYS Data

Under this link, you can find a collection of data we used to generate results presented in our paper. Feel free to download any desired input data for reproducing results of our paper. The directory in the above link consists of:

- **Input:** Contains TCGA mutational data for our three considered cohorts, as well as the used SSN and DysRegNet dysregulation networks in the feather file format.
- **Processed_Mutations**: Contains already preprocessed mutational data based on the output of setup.py. Can be directly used to reproduce results with changed input dysregulation networks.
- **Phenotype_Data**: Contains TCGA phenotype and survival data for the three considered cohorts for validation results.
