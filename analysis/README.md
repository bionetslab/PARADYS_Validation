# PARADYS Analysis

In order to detect patient-specific drivers for a given cohort (with or without assigned impact scores) you can use the script contained in this directory. The input consists of preprocessed data generated by `setup.py`. For a detailed description of how to generate preprocessed data, see the `preprocessing` directory.



## Input specification

In order to run the `analysis.py` script, you need to specify the following input variables:

- `kappa`: Specifies the size of the considered shortest-path neighborhood in the dysregulation networks.
-  `scores`: Boolean variable indicating whether or not to compute ranking scores of drivers.
- `input_dir`: Name of directory that contains preprocessed input data. The list of necessary input data can be found in the `preprocessing/` directory.
- `output_dir`: Name of the output directory where to store patient-specific result files.



## Output specification

The resulting per-patient driver files are stored in the `output_dir`. In such a file, the column  `'drivers'` stores the detected driver gene, `'p-values'` the associated p-value for the edge contained in the column `'dysregulations'`, and `'patient'` the ID of the corresponding patient.
